# Version 1.0.3
- Should be actually fixed now! I'm very sorry, I just uploaded the wrong files for version 1.0.2

# Version 1.0.2
- Made it so if the assetbundles folder is missing, it'll read the main mod folder instead. Thank you very much Squibtastic for helping with it! Should now work when using an installer!

# Version 1.0.1
- Changed the dll name to ToothlessDanceEmote.dll
- Removed useless debug code made in the example I used
- Added a changelog
- Hopefully works now, since Thunderstore wasn't keeping any of the subfolders when using an installer before

# Version 1.0.0
- First Release
